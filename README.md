Federated Learning based Intrusion Detection Systems with Flower, Raspberry Pi 4s and the NSL-KDD dataset

## Overview

This project's aim is implementing an Intrusion Detection System with Federated Learning. The project context stems from the Connected Autonomous Vehicle architecture, and the performance of Intrusion Detection Systems on network communication within the architecture. It utilizes the Flower framework (GitHub - adap/flower) for federated learning and the NSK-KDD dataset for intrusion detection. The core of this system is a Neural Network (NN) model.
